🔐 Password Strength Analyzer

This project is a real-time password strength analyzer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It evaluates how secure a password is based on common validation rules and basic security assumptions.

The tool checks for minimum length, uppercase letters, numbers and special characters. It also detects weak patterns such as numeric only passwords and commonly used password fragments.

In addition to displaying a strength level (Weak / Medium / Strong), it estimates the likelihood of the password being guessed and highlights common attack methods like brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks and credential stuffing to improve security awareness.
